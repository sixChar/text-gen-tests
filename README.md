# text-gen-tests

Several different text models implemented in pytorch and trained on the [Blog Authorship Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/blog-authorship-corpus) dataset to predict the next character.

## Models implemented:
- LSTM

## TODO:
- Implement saving
- Implement linear transformer model
- Implement a more complicated fast weight programmer model
- (Maybe) Implement a self programmin fast weight programmer model
